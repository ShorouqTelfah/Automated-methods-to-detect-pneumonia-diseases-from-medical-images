# Automated-methods-to-detect-pneumonia-diseases-from-medical-images

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung and a quite common disease. There are two common types of pneumonia:

Bacterial pneumonia
Viral Pneumonia

this work is team based work to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to be able to detect healthy lungs from pneumonia infected ones

the dataset that used from Kaggel 

we Used the training data to train the model with CNN which has the minimum loss and maximum accuracy for detecting the images with pneumonia (Using TensorFlow and Keras ).
In the training process we will show how to choose:
Number of convolution-pooling building blocks,
The strides, padding and activation function that give us the maximum accuracy,
A solution to avoid overfitting problem in our code.
